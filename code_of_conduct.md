# Code of Conduct

All members, volunteers and contributors in this project are required to act according to this Code of Conduct. We ask you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Nord a positive and growing project and help us provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone. Let‘s work together to keep the Nord community a place where people feel safe to participate by being respectful of them and their time.

Serious and persistent violations, such as disrespectful, abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, can be reported to us using [any of the contact options listed below](#contact-options).

reports can be sent to us

## Guidelines

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an [open and welcoming environment][5], we as project members, volunteers and contributors pledge to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people, based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, skills, and experiences and
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility, commitment, and effort and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

### Unacceptable Behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, spamming, insulting, rude, mean or derogatory contributions or comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Open Source Etiquettes

Not everyone has experience with [open source][2] communities and [general etiquettes][8] and intuitively knows what is acceptable. The following guidelines are meant to provide a quick overview to help you to avoid common assumptions and pitfalls:

1. Do not feel entitled to free software, support, or advice, especially if you are not a contributor, sponsor, or paying customer. Don‘t ask the project members, volunteers or contributors to report to you and [meet deadlines][7] as if they work for you or owe you something.
2. Read the documentations and determine the cause of your problem before reporting invalid bugs or start impatient conversations in the projects community real-time and content hubs as well as other platforms and infrastructure. Aside from being annoying for everyone, it also keeps the team and contributors from developing while increasing the maintenance overhead.
3. Reckless, surprisingly harsh or ignorant communication is unacceptable, whether public or private. The open source community differs from other communities where a harsh and aggressive tone is often common so this will not be tolerated. The goal is to create projects that are meant to be enjoyed by everyone and inappropriate behavior due to lack of understanding is therefore a [No-Go][6].

## Reporting

We encourage all community members to resolve problems on their own whenever possible. However, if you notice serious and persistent violations, such as disrespectful, abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please contact us using [any of the contact options listed below](#contact-options). Your reports will be taken seriously and not dismissed or argued with.

## Responsibilities

Project members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They will enforce the community standards as necessary to protect everyone‘s well-being and to ensure that all real-time communication and content hubs as well as other platforms and project infrastructure can be used as intended.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team or community leaders responsible for enforcement through any official communication hub using [any of the contact options listed below](#contact-options). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter and maintain confidentiality. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Any [unacceptable behavior](#unacceptable-behavior) is not to be interpreted how you like, there are no “loopholes”. Anyone claiming not to be breaking the rules due to it “not being in the rules” will result in the according consequence. Please always feel free to contact the project team if you‘re unsure about any rule.
Consequences will be issued after one serious infraction or failing to acknowledge warnings of minor infractions. This is non-negotiable.

Community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project’s management.

### Violation Consequences

If a participant engages in any behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the project team members may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project, exclusion from any interaction and loss of all rights in this project.

Project team members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Decisions about consequences of violations of this Code of Conduct are made by this project’s team members as named above and will not be discussed with the person responsible for the violation.

1. **Correction** — Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
   The consequence will be a private, written warning from the project team or community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. **Warning** — A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   The consequence will be a warning about continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in any of the project‘s community hubs and used platforms like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   The consequence will be a temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
4. **Permanent Ban** — Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
   The consequence will be a permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project and community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project and it‘s community in public spaces. This includes real-time communication or content hubs, any platform used to represent the project as well as infrastructure managed by the project’s management.

Examples of representing out project or community include acting as an appointed representative on online platforms or offline events, or using an official project e-mail address. Representation of a project may also be further defined and clarified by the project’s management.
