# Support & Community

> **Note**
> By interacting with the Nord project, organization, and community you agree to abide to its [code of conduct][4] and follow [general open source contribution guidelines][11] and [etiquettes][10]!

This document provides information on how to find help and support, as well as references and ways to join the [Nord project community][3].
To help us help you, please read through and adhere to the guidelines!

> **Note**
> Please understand that Nord maintainers are only humans who spend their free time on open source projects like this, next to their day job and activities, and are therefore only available to a limited extent to address general support questions. **[You are not entitled][2] to free support and [open source project maintainers owe you nothing][1]!**

If you [encountered a bug][18] or want to contribute to the project in another way please see the [contribution guidelines][9] instead on how to do so.

## Questions & Help

> **Note**
> Please do not use GitHub issues in any Nord repository to ask questions, instead use one of the dedicated platforms listed below!

If your question is purely technical or code related, please **use the [GitHub issue search][19] first** to check if the same or a similar issue has already been reported!
If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one, but only if you can add new or otherwise helpful information or context. Submitting a comment that reflects already known information or is only intended to show that you are also affected (“me too“ or “+1“ comments) only creates notification noise and increases the maintenance overhead for the project members and overall time until a solution can be provided. If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same problem that you are experiencing, **only [open a new issue when it is an actual problem with the project code itself][18]** and mention the already existing issue since closed issues are no longer monitored and processed.
In most cases the problem is not related to the code itself and therefore the appropriate platform for your question is one of the one listed below.

### Platforms

To ask a question or find general support and help, please use the following platforms and communities:

1. [**GitHub discussions**][5] — The main place for the Nord community to collaborate with the community and [maintainers][26] about anything around Nord. Please [check if there is already an open or resolved discussion][27] that matches your topic or problem before opening a new one. Existing discussions can be extended with more (or newer) information or by [upvoting helpful comments][24] or [whole discussions][25] or simply [add a reaction][28].
2. [**The `#nordtheme:matrix.org` Matrix space**][6] — The main place to chat with or talk to community members in the official Nord [Matrix][7] space. Please read the platform specific guidelines beforehand and use the appropriate channels within this space that is especially designed for supportive interactions.
   - [**The Nord Discord server**][8] — An alternative platform to the Nord Matrix space for everyone who prefers [Discord][30]. Please read the platform specific guidelines beforehand and use the appropriate channels within this space that is especially designed for supportive interactions

### Asking Quality Questions

Help us help you!
Before you ask a question, please [spend time up front to frame your question][29] to help your ideas come across effectively and save [everyone involved in the contribution process][12] time in the long run.

Here's what you can do before actually asking your question, which might already help you solve your problem yourself:

- **Find already existing answers** — Search the corresponding platform to find out if a similar question has been asked. If so, but it has not been answered or resolved yet, please **only contribute new information to this context** in order to help to, and get help too, but avoid “+1“ or “me too“ replies in any form which only causes unnecessary noise and maintenance overhead for everyone.
- (Optional) **Ask your trusted rubber duck** — Try to [reflect your steps and problem symptoms to a _rubber duck_ up front][14], or alternatively any other objectified being, which might maybe already helps to find the root cause of your problem.

If none of the steps above help, please make sure to follow the next points, which are similar to the steps when creating a [bug report][18], to formulate your question:

- [**Learn how to ask good questions**][29].
- **Prevent the [XY problem][13]** — Do not ask about your attempted solution but describe your actual problem instead.
- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for your problem to help to make it clear in a listing of support requests and also help others to find it when they have the same question.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **There is rarely too much information** — Please always provide as much detail and context as possible, e.g. your configuration and environment, to help supporters to understand the whole context, reproduce the problem and help you to resolve your issue faster.
- (Optional) **[Attach files][16] like screenshots or videos** if appropriate, support your question with visual resources which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- (Optional) **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a [MCVE][15] to help supporters to reproduce the problem behavior, e.g. by using GitHub‘s free features like a [Codespaces][21] or [Gists][23], or other free services like [Codesandbox][22].
  - (Optional) **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste snippets. If you are providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks][17] or [attach files to the issue][16].

## Updates, Communities & Content

Support can also mean that you are looking for supportive content and information about your favorite project instead of support in a problem related context. This is where the following other [Nord communities & platforms][3] get interesting that can help to keep up-to-date, collaborate with other community members or contribute content of any other form:

**Updates** — announcements, updates and more.
